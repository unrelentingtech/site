<p>So there are <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=talos-workstation&amp;num=1">fully blob-free desktop computers</a>. For $3100. Based on… IBM POWER8. Wow. I didn’t even think IBM would be the one to work on the most open CPUs.</p>
<p>A much more realistic way to blob-free computing seems to be <a href="https://github.com/christinaa/rpi-open-firmware">the open Raspberry Pi firmware</a>. It’s not a drop-in replacement yet, but it already runs ARM code with access to the SD card and the UART console!</p>
<p>Oh, and the Raspberry Pi is great from the “<a href="http://blog.invisiblethings.org/2015/12/23/state_harmful.html">State considered harmful</a>” perspective — everything is loaded from the SD card. Which also makes experimenting with replacing the firmware very safe and easy.</p>
