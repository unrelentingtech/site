Discovery of the day: Blender has an SDL2 backend, just build it with `-DWITH_GHOST_SDL=ON`. If you also have GLEW built for Wayland…

Blender will run on Wayland!

Well, "run" — the window is glitchy as hell. The best thing though is that these glitches showed Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup tiles to me (since I launched DCSS before to test SDL — for some reason I had to downgrade to 2.0.7 to run most apps on Wayland.)
