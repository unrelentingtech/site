<p>One of the worst things about current official Twitter UX is how ridiculously easy it is to lose a tweet while writing it.</p>
<p>On the iPad, the compose view you get when you tap the Reply button protects you from losing your tweet, but <em>not</em> the text field at the bottom of the screen when you’re viewing a tweet/conversation. If you accidentally swipe away that screen, IT’S LOST. And the swipe works literally <em>everywhere</em>. Even on the damn Tweet button. I’ve accidentally discarded several replies instead of posting them.</p>
<p>On Android, both reply fields don’t let you discard a tweet w/o confirmation.</p>
<p>But on the Web, you can lose your text <em>anywhere</em>. Accidentally clicked the darkened background around the popup? Pressed Esc? Your reply text is lost.</p>
<p>(It’s not just Twitter. It seems like NO ONE CARES ABOUT THIS ANYMORE. Firefox Share is another example.)</p>
