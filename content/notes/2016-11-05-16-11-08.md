<p>Moved my code directory <code>~/src</code>, which contains Vim plugins, to a NAS mounted over NFS (so now it’s the same on my desktop PC, the VMs running on it, and my Raspberry Pi).</p>
<p>Neovim became very slow, with starting, opening files or even switching buffers taking 50 seconds.</p>
<p>So I ran <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/12216578">the profiler</a> and… it was <a href="https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vim">the EditorConfig plugin</a>! Even with the external C core.</p>
