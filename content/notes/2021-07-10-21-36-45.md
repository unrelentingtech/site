This website is now ~~fully owned by Bezos~~ very very Serverlessâ„¢!
Built using [mildly forked](https://github.com/unrelentingtech/zola) [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) in GitHub Actions, uploaded to S3, content-delivered via CloudFront.
And even DNS is now Route 53, otherwise properly having CloudFront on an apex (bare) domain would be difficult.
Webmentions are outsourced to [Webmention.io](https://webmention.io/) (+ a tiny endpoint converting their webhook to GitHub rebuild command is hosted on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/)) and micropub is gone, at least for now.
(When I have nothing better to do I might just make an app running in Lambda that would edit the git repo in response to Micropub requests, send outgoing webmentions, be a custom auth endpoint, eventually also handle incoming webmentions, and so on.)

I'm glad I only did this *now*: [CloudFront Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-cloudfront-functions-run-your-code-at-the-edge-with-low-latency-at-any-scale/) did not exist until a few months ago.
With this functionality, it is a quite capable CDN.
Still clunky and weird in some aspects though (e.g. "Default Root Object" applying even after a Function rewrites `/something/` to `/` was quite surprising)
