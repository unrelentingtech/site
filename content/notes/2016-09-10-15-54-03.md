<p>#fdroidfinds: <a href="https://github.com/SyntaxBlitz/PluckLock">PluckLock</a>: “Immediately lock your phone if someone snatches it from your hand”. Great idea. Very simple code. Doesn’t work so well for the “quickly taking the phone from a table” scenario. Detects dropping the phone onto the couch though :D</p>
