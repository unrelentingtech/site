<p>evdev support in the psm driver (with proper support for Synaptics touchpads and Thinkpad Trackpoints) <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/commit/bc8448b7c73bbbcaf15b375eb9648e963bcc8334">landed in FreeBSD -CURRENT</a>! Just set up libinput in Xorg for all devices, very nice. (Without device autodetection â€” with devd, Xorg wants to use the old keyboard and mouse drivers. Using the udev backend would work, but freebsd-ports-graphics is currently meh.)</p><p>Also <a href="https://github.com/FreeBSDDesktop/freebsd-base-graphics/issues/145">people are working on suspend-resume issues</a>!</p>
