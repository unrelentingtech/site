Back in the mid-2000s, people worked on <a href="http://programatica.cs.pdx.edu/House/">writing operating systems in Haskell</a>! Even with GUIs.

Thereâ€™s also <a href="http://squeaknos.blogspot.com/2011/03/squeaknos-release-updated.html">a Squeak/Pharo Smalltalk on bare x86 project, last updated in 2011</a>.

I guess all we have now is <a href="https://www.redox-os.org">Redox</a>. I hope it will become a truly successful operating system not written in C.
