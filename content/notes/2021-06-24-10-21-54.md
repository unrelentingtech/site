I really haven't been posting on my website, have I?
Yeahâ€¦ I kinda don't always have the energy/motivation/time to maintain a website like this.

BTW the choice to generate static HTML in sweetroll2 really helped with keeping the website up.
For the last couple months (?) the backend was down because the Mnesia DB for the job queue somehow got messed up.
But that was fine as long as I wasn't posting, the pages were still up.

Maybe I'll reinvent the backend once again.. with more "cloud" outsourcing to get rid of as much maintenance as possible.. or something.
