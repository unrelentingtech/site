[Ported a recent version of the Weston compositor](https://github.com/myfreeweb/weston/commit/5df4a6830884a04a94b4694dc0e05095b64fd719) to FreeBSD. Using this as my actual desktop for two days now â€” works fine. I miss window tiling and a good info bar, but this thing, this thing lets you just rotate windows arbitrarily!! :D
