<p>Wow, a researcher from a German university sent me a survey about copying code from Stack Overflow — and not just randomly! Because they found <a href="https://github.com/myfreeweb/antigravity/blob/34d40bbd14a47342f6cab2f00a171b38f0e6f122/src/main/java/com/floatboth/antigravity/ui/FileDescriptionHelper.java#L34-L41">a snippet in one of my repos</a>.</p>
<p>So, SO answers are CC BY-SA licensed, which is terrible (you basically aren’t supposed to use it in BSD/MIT/ISC or CC0/Unlicense/WTFPL code!)</p>
<p>But that particular project was GPL licensed, which is compatible with Share Alike! And that’s particularly amazing — most of my projects are under Unlicense or ISC. I just decided to use the GPL for that one because it was an Android GUI app.</p>
