<p>Apple just announced a new image codec that's based on HEVC but it's not named <a href="https://bellard.org/bpg/">BPG</a>?! New proprietary thing? No, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Image_File_Format">an ISO standard</a> apparently, created by MPEG.</p><p>It's sad that Apple likes MPEG though. I wish they didn't hate Google and just adopted WebP.</p>
