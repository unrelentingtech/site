<p>Since <a href="https://github.com/myfreeweb/sweetroll/commit/1bdf8e1469c7388e1e6468df1ad0bb62295d4024">2017-02-01</a> I've been working on a big change to Sweetroll, the engine that powers this website, and today it's finally live, right here! (Also it's now on my newer VPS, hosted at prgmr and running HardenedBSD 11. The old one was FreeBSD 10 at DigitalOcean.)</p>
<p>tl;dr about the change: from one Haskell app powered by a <a href="https://github.com/myfreeweb/gitson">Git+JSON store</a> and embedded Duktape templates (lol) to two services (Haskell + Node.js) backed by Postgres. It's really cool. I'll be writing more documentation for it soon.</p>
