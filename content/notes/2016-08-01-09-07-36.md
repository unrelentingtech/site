<p>Upgraded FreeBSD on my laptop to <code>drm-next-4.6</code> (branch with GPU drivers ported from Linux 4.6). So, <code>*ERROR* timeout waiting for SBI to complete read transaction</code> dmesg spam (that slowed down booting for a couple seconds) is gone. New dmesg spam is <code>hdac0: Unexpected unsolicited response from address 0: 00000000</code> at the end of the boot process, right before the login prompt, and not taking any time. <code>clinfo</code> doesn’t show <code>self-test failed</code> anymore. VAAPI video decoding acceleration still works. Haven’t tried connecting an external display yet.</p>
<p>The only real problem is that Firefox with full OpenGL compositing (<code>layers.acceleration.force-enabled</code>) is artifacting, but whatever, it’s fine without that.</p>
<p>Current status: reinstalling 1114 packages because o m g the ABI version changed to 12 :D</p>
