The recent standardization of [Encrypted Media Extensions](https://www.w3.org/TR/encrypted-media/) by the W3C isn't actually a big deal. EME was *already used* in production with multiple independent implementations (which is a W3C requirement). Before that, Flash and Silverlight provided similar things. Worse, some video services used (and *still use*) *custom NPAPI plugins* to protect their content.

And yet, a lot of people on several link discussion websites posted ridiculous slippery slope doomsday scenarios. Like, *now*, **NOW** the Web will be no longer open and free, full of DRM for *everything*, even *news articles* will be DRM'd, and proprietary software will run in the browsers instead of "open" scripts (that you can View Source), and someone even seriously suggested that browsers might *stop playing non-DRM content*.

How come this never happened when Flash was extremely popular and included DRM capabilities? ;-) It's as if no one except for movie studios actually wants to use DRM.

Also, there's this innovative technique for proprietary software on the web. Actually it existed since forever and it's calledâ€¦ doing the interesting things on the server side.
