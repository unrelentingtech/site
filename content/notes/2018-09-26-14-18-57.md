Finally got around to actually trying out [ZeroTier](https://zerotier.com). It's pretty awesome!

Okay, it has a couple downsides:

- it's not automatically a mesh network, you *have* to designate a node as a "moon" to make it pass traffic between other nodes (that couldn't punch holes through NAT)
- the Android client is not open source and doesn't have UI to tell it to orbit a moon

But other than thatâ€¦ the simplicity is lovely. No screwing around with config files, restarts and whatnot. Just a very small & easy set of admin commands. And automatic IP address assignment (especially 6PLANE) is amazing.
