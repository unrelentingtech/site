Website update: [imgroll](https://github.com/myfreeweb/imgroll) image optimization
has been deployed. Now I can finally properly share pics! :D

{{ photo(id="cat-meme") }}

How it works: the micropub media endpoint in sweetroll2 uploads to S3 (with a callback URL in the metadata), returns an S3 URL.
The imgroll Lambda notices the upload, extracts metadata, does processing, uploads resized versions to S3,
POSTs to the callback a rich object with metadata and links to the sizes.
But from there, there's three ways of getting the object into the post instead of the URL:

- if everything goes right, it's processed quickly: the callback is forwarded to the [post editor](https://github.com/myfreeweb/micro-panel) via Server-Sent Events and the URL gets replaced with the object right in the browser;
- if the post is saved with the S3 URL before the processing is done: the callback handler modifies all posts with that URL in any field;
- same but after the processing is done: the micropub endpoint replaces all URLs for which these callbacks have happened.

Also, the images are served from CloudFront now, on a CNAME subdomain (with a certificate issued by AWS ACM).
Which has required.. switching DNS providers: the [1984 FreeDNS](https://www.1984.is/product/freedns/)
was being buggy and wouldn't apply my changes.
Now I'm on [desec.io](https://desec.io) which is currently API-only and has no web UI,
but that's actually cool because I now have all the DNS records in a script that deploys them using curl.
