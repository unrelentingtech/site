Noticed the `mgb` driver for [Microchip LAN7430](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/LAN7430) (/31) NIC in FreeBSD commit logs.
Huh, interesting stuff: Microchip publishes so much documentation..
a "Programmer's Guide" PDF with lots of driver pseudocode, and even evaluation board design files!
