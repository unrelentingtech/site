I rewrote [micro-panel](https://github.com/myfreeweb/micro-panel) (the "admin panel" for this site) from scratch
with [LitElement](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element) and no material design components.
It's really tiny now!
The minified bundle is 57kb (and that still includes [a code editor](https://github.com/myfreeweb/codeflask-element) with syntax highlighting).
The previous version was nearly 1mb.

Also, the new version is a bit simplified: no iframe mode, only cookie auth.
And it doesn't wrap the whole page in an element, it's now more of a set of elements.

Check out this piece of code, by the way:

```javascript
async close () {
  if ('animate' in this && 'finished' in Animation.prototype) {
    await this.animate({transform: ['none', 'translateY(100vh)']},
      {duration: 300, easing: 'ease-out'}).finished
  }
  this.hidden = true
}
```
