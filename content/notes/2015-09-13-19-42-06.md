<p>Trying to run FreeBSD directly on hardware. Some people say that free operating systems work better on older computers… well, nope.</p>
<p>On my old MacBook Air, it crashes when you try to do any significant disk I/O (like, you know, installation, or just unpacking an archive to a RAM disk) or when starting X. On 10.2-STABLE, it’s <code>general protection fault while in kernel mode</code> or <code>page fault while in kernel mode</code>, on 11-CURRENT it’s <code>vm_page_alloc: page 0x... has unexpected queue N</code>.</p>
<p>On a more recent iMac, it works great. <code>bge(4)</code> Ethernet, nVidia graphics, a USB sound card, USB 3.0 hard drives. 4K videos on YouTube play smoothly. Changing display brightness doesn’t work, but darkening the screen with <code>xbrightness</code> or <code>xrandr</code> is okay on a desktop.</p>
<p>But I wanted to use it on the laptop :-(</p>
