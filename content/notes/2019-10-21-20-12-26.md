It's nice that Microsoft is pushing for all pen tablet (stylus) support in laptops to use
[the obvious generic set of HID reports](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/component-guidelines/required-hid-top-level-collections#integrated-windows-pen-collection).
Quite probably, Microsoft is to thank for the Wacom touchscreen in my Pixelbook implementing that.
I've seen the *heaps* of code in the Linux kernel to support Wacom's custom protocols, that would've been very NOT fun to implement :)

Took like an hour max to get to working reports in console (dmesg), all that's left is to evdev-ify it.
Coming to [iichid](https://github.com/wulf7/iichid) pull requests soon
(but for now there's no multiple device support in `hidbus`, so won't be mergeable yet).
