Cool ARM laptop news that I missed somehow:

- the cause of custom EFI binaries not running on Windows-on-Snapdragon laptops was found: [it was alignment](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2018-11/msg00298.html). Now GRUB works. (Still, Qualcomm firmware is very weird, [you're always in a hypervisor](https://twitter.com/WhatAintInside/status/1070965434114023424), [the ACPI implementation has some very strange quirks](https://twitter.com/WhatAintInside/status/1070966178783379456) and [uses PEPs](https://twitter.com/WhatAintInside/status/1071302004968996865).)
