Happy new year! Since I haven't been posted in a while, here's what I've been up to lately:

- adopted [Wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) as my terminal emulator, contributing a bunch of (mostly Wayland-related) [patches](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aunrelentingtech) in process
- figured out [a minimal tool](https://github.com/unrelentingtech/micloudfaker) to make Xiaomi power strips work without the "cloud"
- saw a SIMD-accelerated `tac` line-reversing utility and immediately [ported it to arm64 NEON/AdvSIMD](https://github.com/neosmart/tac/pull/5)
- helped out with [firmware](https://github.com/digmorepaka/thinkpad-firmware-patches/pull/13) and [EC](https://github.com/hamishcoleman/thinkpad-ec/issues/203) (just testing with the latter) patches for the Thinkpad L430/L530
- developed a FreeBSD driver for the SPI keyboard/touchpad attachment in Apple MacBooks (currently only [in my fork](https://github.com/DankBSD/base) and only tested on the 2015 MBP, spibus-side prerequisites are in review)
  - related: got the Magic Trackpad 2 (which uses a compact packet format but similar surroundings to bcm5974) working too
- started learning PCB design with [Horizon EDA](https://horizon-eda.org/)
  - which has *of course* resulted in making [some new tools](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/pull/639) for it
- found bugs in [the mold linker](https://github.com/rui314/mold/issues/152) and [zlib-ng](https://github.com/zlib-ng/zlib-ng/issues/1088)
- made new [Wayfire](https://wayfire.org/) plugins: [wf-globalgestures](https://github.com/DankBSD/wf-globalgestures), [wf-dynspaces](https://github.com/DankBSD/wf-dynspaces), [wf-touchpad-gesture-drag](https://github.com/DankBSD/wf-touchpad-gesture-drag) (yeah, turns out 3-finger drag is easy with current libinput: it's a hold-cancel-swipe sequence!)
- finally made a [freebsd-embedded-hal](https://github.com/unrelentingtech/freebsd-embedded-hal) Rust crate
- just now added dark mode to [micro-panel](https://github.com/unrelentingtech/micro-panel) where I'm writing this

Unusually, I do have a legit new year's resolution this time: I should blog more! Want to publish some long-form things here.
