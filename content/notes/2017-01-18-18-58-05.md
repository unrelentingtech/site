<p>Noticed a worrying trend in web server libraries: lack of first-class support for running on Unix domain sockets and on user-supplied sockets of any kind. Sometimes it needs <a href="https://github.com/softprops/hyperlocal">third party libraries with over 200 lines of code</a>… but <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/612">Erlang didn’t have native support for unix sockets until 2015</a>!</p>
<p>In 2017, let’s make sure all web app stacks support opening Unix sockets, running on already opened sockets, socket activation and graceful shutdown! I made <a href="https://github.com/myfreeweb/soad">a thing</a> that uses that kind of stuff and the only server that was completely ready out of the box was Ruby’s <a href="https://github.com/puma/puma/blob/master/docs/systemd.md#socket-activation">Puma</a>.</p>
