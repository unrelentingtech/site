<p>People running Postgres on ZFS in Serious Productionâ„¢ will tell you to set <code>recordsize</code> to 8k or 16k, because performance. Don't listen to them if you're just running personal stuff on VPSes with expensive storage! Small <code>recordsize</code> kills <code>compressratio</code>. So turn it up and rewrite the database with <code>VACUUM FULL ANALYZE</code>. (My Matrix server: going up from 16K to 128K raised <code>compressratio</code> from 2.11x to 3.08x! That's with lz4.)</p>
