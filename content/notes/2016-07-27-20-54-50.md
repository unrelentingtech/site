<p>Just set up a network scanner — an old Canon that’s fully powered through USB, plugged into my OpenWRT router, which I configured to run <code>saned</code> with <code>xinetd</code>. Just because I had the scanner :D</p>
<p>By the way, looks like it’s also possible to connect to <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/bluetooth.6lowpan">6LoWPAN over Bluetooth LE</a> on OpenWRT. I’d like to play with 6LoWPAN but ironically, <em>the</em> cheap &amp; compact &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/qrs/status/706552734170935296">low power</a> DIY IoT thing, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266">ESP8266</a>, uses Wi-Fi with WPA2. <a href="https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/issues/1032">Even with EAP-TLS auth</a>! Which is also <a href="https://jackofallit.wordpress.com/2012/02/15/turn-a-60-120-router-into-an-enterprise-class-wireless-router-with-openwrt/">a thing OpenWRT does</a>.</p>
