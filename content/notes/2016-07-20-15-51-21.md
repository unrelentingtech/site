<p>Modern Android problems: update to a CyanogenMod nightly which is based on a slightly newer AOSP → need to flash <code>vendor.img</code> from the newest factory image → WPA2 EAP-TLS Wi-Fi connection starts behaving weirdly: not connecting, then connecting and finding “no internet” after a few seconds, etc.</p>
<p>Last time I fixed this by issuing a new certificate and using it, now even that doesn’t seem to help. Decided “fuck it” and connected to my old WPA2 Personal network :D</p>
