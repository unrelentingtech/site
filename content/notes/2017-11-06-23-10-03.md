Finally made some updates to this website! On the surface, [slightly refreshed design](https://github.com/myfreeweb/sweetroll/commit/83312d85ec464508322869557f3a9c5e64d7038a) (single column). Under the hood, the Haskell part is now [build with GHC 8.2](https://github.com/myfreeweb/sweetroll/commit/08273485bed5de0c766748828e1821add35c202a) and the database is [upgraded to Postgres 10](https://github.com/myfreeweb/mf2sql/commit/ddb9383fc2fa67661b6a6ec43d4bae9335794dfc).

Also, a new section: [KnowledgeBase](/kb). It's kinda like a "personal wiki" thing. Alphabetically sorted list of pages, WikiStyleTitles that [are put into URLs without lowercasing](https://github.com/myfreeweb/sweetroll/commit/2f27a9264c4dc1f4ae9fe678a29c1d75aa997957), and these pages don't end up on the front page.
