<p>I made <a href="https://unrelenting.technology/crawllog/">a thing</a> that lets me post <a href="https://unrelenting.technology/gamelogs">Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup game logs to my website</a>!</p>
<p>It has… kind of a long story, actually. So back in 2013 when I was a huge fan of App.net, I wanted to make an App.net client that would be “like <a href="http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/Battlelog">Battlelog</a> but for Crawl”. (Why would anyone use that instead of <a href="https://crawl.develz.org/tavern/">the Tavern</a>, I don’t know. I thought I could get DCSS players to sign up for App.net :D)</p>
<p>So I wrote <a href="https://github.com/myfreeweb/clj-dcss">clj-dcss</a>, a working parser for DCSS morgue files (out of date by now; also turns out it’s a bad idea to parse the whole log), and <a href="https://github.com/myfreeweb/rxjava-http-tail">rxjava-http-tail</a> for following logs on public servers. And Crawllog itself was also somewhat complete, but I never actually deployed it.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2016, I no longer use App.net, I’m a huge fan of <a href="https://indieweb.org">the IndieWeb</a> and I made a <a href="https://github.com/myfreeweb/crawllog">new Crawllog</a> :D</p>
