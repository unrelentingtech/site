<p>So Amazon Lambda has a 6 MB limit on request (and response) size. Binary files have to be Base64 encoded (LOL) which makes the limit even SMALLER! So my <a href="https://github.com/myfreeweb/sweetroll/tree/a82cbbcb28d06d42e6839df07bdfcc1a30dd6a94/sweetroll-mu">micropub media endpoint</a> chokes on full DSLR resolution photos. Yeah the "right way" is to have the API Gateway endpoint upload to S3, and the upload event trigger the Lambda processing which would download from S3, and use a separate Lambda for authentication on that endpointâ€¦ but I need the processed URLs in the response body. I need everything to happen in one request! How did AWS engineers not see that use case coming?!</p>
