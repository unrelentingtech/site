<p>The <a href="https://www.freshports.org/graphics/blender/">default build options for Blender in FreeBSD</a> are weird. <code>CYCLES=off</code>‽ <code>FFMPEG=off</code>‽ <code>COLLADA=off</code>‽ <code>CAMERATRACK=off</code>‽ Why. Another package to compile instead of <code>pkg install</code>ing…</p>
<p>By the way, only recently I’ve learned that Blender is the FOSS answer to not only 3ds max + V-Ray, but also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42AQ_EtRVq4">Premiere/Final Cut</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVPcT0dJmoY">After Effects/Motion</a>. (Damn, that makes <em>so much sense</em>! If you have a 3D animation editor, if you put video into it, it becomes a video editor!)</p>
<p>The sequence editor looks like old Final Cut, not new Final Cut… But it’s Blender. The program that shows Python code in UI elements’ tooltips to show how to do the same things programmatically. I guess I should be able to make a plugin that makes the timeline magnetic, if such a plugin doesn’t exist yet.</p>
<p>Oh also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxCy4tOrCqw">this video series is sooooo pretty</a></p>
