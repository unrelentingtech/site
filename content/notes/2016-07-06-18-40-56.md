<p>The Windows install on my desktop suddenly decided to start resetting some settings every time I log in. The wallpaper, Start and taskbar pinned items, Firefox profile… Thankfully, not the Steam profile :D</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, recently I was reminded of one of the most infuriating Windows things. It’s 2016 and Windows is still not UTF-8 everywhere. The <code>cmd</code> console is whatever (CP1251 for Russian locale), Visual Studio saves by default in whatever (I’ve seen CP1251 and… UTF-8 <em>with BOM</em>). There’s also the <code>\r\n</code> newline stuff. And Windows users are convinced that Windows defaults aren’t the problem, it’s those weird Unix people who cause problems.</p>
