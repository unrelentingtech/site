"Why do programs I compile become all-zero files after rebooting?"

well, maybe that untested filesystem-related kernel patch you applied has something to do with it :D

But seriously, if anyone wants to make a very cursed unix system:
apply [this diff](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D22130?id=63594) (note: old version by now)
to FreeBSD from around now (say the beginning of 2020 â€” happy new year!),
build programs using clang/lld 9.x and reboot.
