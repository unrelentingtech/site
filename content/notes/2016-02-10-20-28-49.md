<p>True story:</p>
<p>A friend is writing some C++ in Visual Studio. There’s a template class with a copy constructor like this one:</p>
<pre class="c++"><code>    SomeThingClass(const SomeThignClass&amp; other) { …
</code></pre>
<p>She asks me about the weird error on this line – something about the “return type is int by default” behavior from old C not being allowed anymore. What the hell, this is a constructor. We spend, like, ten minutes in a WTF state.</p>
<p>Then we decide to copy the code to my laptop and compile with clang.</p>
<pre><code> error: no template named &#39;SomeThignClass&#39;; did you mean &#39;SomeThingClass&#39;?
</code></pre>
<p>Moral of the story: even two people can just <em>not</em> notice a little typo where <a href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/matt.davis/cmabridge/">the oredr of lettres is swapepd</a>. Computers are better at this. UNLESS THE COMPUTER IS RUNNING MSVC</p>
