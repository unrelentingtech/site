<p>A couple days ago, I saw an email from Keybase saying that someone I know started tracking me. So I typed the command to do the same and… realized I don’t remember my GPG passphrase. I’ve been using it mostly for signing git tags, but I haven’t done that in a couple months.</p>
<p>Brute force with <a href="https://roguedaemon.net/rephrase/README.html">rephrase</a> and even John the Ripper didn’t help. Found the revocation certificate, printed on paper. OCR’d, fixed the text, typed it manually – “Bad signature”.</p>
<p>Today, I needed to actually sign a git tag. Guess what. I remembered the passphrase! :D</p>
