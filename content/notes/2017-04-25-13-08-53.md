<p>I made a WebExtension! It’s called <a href="https://github.com/myfreeweb/transmitter">Transmitter</a> for <a href="https://transmissionbt.com">Transmission</a>. It lets me add torrents to the <code>transmission-daemon</code> instance running on my home server. And watch their status. I think Transmission actually allows you to expose the remote API in desktop versions as well.</p>
<p>tl;dr on WebExtensions: it’s Chrome’s extension API, but with <code>Promise</code>s and it’s a W3C standard. Fully supported in Firefox. Chrome/Opera need a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill">tiny polyfill</a> for the <code>Promise</code> support. MS Edge <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill/issues/3">can be supported too</a>.</p>
<p>Publishing experience: Chrome’s store asks for $5 to get your stuff published (one time payment for up to 20 extensions) and there’s no pre-moderation. Addons.Mozilla is pre-moderated but the extension shows up on its URL before approval. Opera is pre-moderated and the extension doesn’t show up before it’s moderated.</p>
