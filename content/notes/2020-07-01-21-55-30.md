~~Wow, about a month ago [Spot](https://spot.io/) (ex-Spotinst),
the service that can auto-restore an EC2 spot instance after it gets killed, fixed their arm64 support!
(Used to be that it would always set the AMI's "architecture" metadata to amd64, haha.)~~

And of course their support didn't notify me that it was ~~fixed~~,
the service didn't auto-notify me that an instance finally was successfully restored after months of trying and failing,
AWS didn't notify either (it probably can but I haven't set anything up?),
so I wasted a few bucks running a spare inaccessible clone server of my website.
Oh well, at least now I can use a spot instance again without worrying about manual restore.

UPD: hmm, it still tried `i386` on another restore! dang it.
