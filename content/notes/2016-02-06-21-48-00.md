<p>Trying to get into <a href="https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/NetHack">NetHack</a> again, after several years of playing <a href="http://crawl.develz.org">Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup</a> when I wanted to play a roguelike. I missed the complex item interactions and stuff, but not the frustration. Crawl is just SO much better designed.</p>
