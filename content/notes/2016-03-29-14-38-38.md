<p>The <a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2016/03/my_heroic_and_lazy_stand_against_ifttt/">IFTTT vs Pinboard thing</a> happened just as I was planning to use it to <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/PESOS">post</a> bookmarks from Pinboard to this website. This plus the general desire to use open source software on my own server led me to exploring alternatives…</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cantino/huginn">Huginn</a> is the most popular one, but it’s not a good fit for my low-memory VPS. Unicorn/DelayedJob/MySQL? Uh… nope. So, the urge to Write My Own Thing is very strong :D But in <a href="https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/714541936430813185">the Pinboard Twitter thread</a> people have suggested <a href="https://github.com/bipio-server/bipio">bip.io</a> and <a href="https://github.com/node-red/node-red">Node-RED</a>. Looks like I’ll try Node-RED first, because <em>it does not use a fscking database</em>! Just plain old files.</p>
