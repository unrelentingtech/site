Building a [reader](https://indieweb.org/reader) on your website is not too hard when you already have webmention processing (so you have code to parse entries and whatnot). So I kinda have one now. There's even some Microsub support, but that's not complete yet.

There's a funny bug in my feed fetching though: [OAuth for the open web](https://aaronparecki.com/2018/07/07/7/oauth-for-the-open-web) is always on top of the feed (its published date gets set to feed fetch time every time) :D
