<p>I can’t believe how miserably GUI tools fail at file formats. So, I received a transparent JPEG recently. After the WTF moment, I ran <code>/usr/bin/file</code> and it told me it’s a PNG file (renamed to <code>.jpg</code>).</p>
<p>Here’s how GUI apps handle it:</p>
<p>OS X’s Finder actually ran the format detection to display it correctly in Quick Look, but didn’t say “PNG renamed to JPEG” as the file format. It just said “JPEG image!”</p>
<p>Photoshop showed an error and refused to open it.</p>
