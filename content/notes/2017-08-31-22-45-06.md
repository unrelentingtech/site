Recent discovery: forwarding serial ports over the network is pretty easy. Useful for embedded development!

For example, if you're working with an ESP8266 SDK in a Linux VM, but the device is attached to a FreeBSD machine: run something like <code>doas python2 [~/rfc2217_server.py](https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial/blob/master/examples/rfc2217_server.py) -p 8266 /dev/cuaU0</code> on the host and use something like `rfc2217://192.168.1.2:8266` as the `--port` argument to esptool.

(Yeah, use that script. Other RFC2217 implementations don't seem to support binary mode for some reason.)
