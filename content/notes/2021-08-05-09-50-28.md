OpenPAM has [some very strange behavior for `chauthtok` since 2007](https://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-userlevel/2007/08/25/0006.html) and I just hit that. Whyâ€¦ would you just completely change the semantics of `sufficient` for the preliminary check thing?! This literally only seems to accomplish one thing: breaking password changes for additional password sources (that are not the last one).
