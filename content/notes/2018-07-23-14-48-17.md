Scaleway's ARM64 VPS has been [successfully depenguinated](https://community.online.net/t/freebsd-on-arm64/6678)! :)
Now you can run FreeBSD on four ThunderX cores, 2GB RAM and 50GB SSD for 3€/month. Awesome! 

Also, in the process, I finally discovered [the cause of GPT partitions sometimes disappearing on reboot](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=229977). It was the size of the partition table. It's 128 by default, but sometimes it's not — e.g. on the FreeBSD installer memstick image, it's *2*. Creating a third partition with `gpart` "succeeded", but the partition disappeared on reboot.
