Sometimes I waste hours of debugging on really really silly things…

Why do I keep thinking that e.g. `0 || 69` (typically written with variables obviously) in C would return `69` rather than `1`?!
Well it must be because C's "booleans are just numbers" thing makes me think that the operators would also do… number things. No they don't! >_<
