<p>Quake Champions is awesome (as in the gameplay â€” performance is meh).</p>
<p>Amazon Web Services is not awesome: it wasn't really obvious that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/credits-ri/">promotional credits aren't spent on reserved EC2 instances</a> :( Also HardenedBSD was behaving weird on it (<a href="https://github.com/HardenedBSD/secadm/issues/36">secadm kernel panic</a>, Python libssl segfaults).</p>
<p>But with regular FreeBSD I've set up a Matrix homeserver (Synapse) on EC2! I am now <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@greg:unrelenting.technology">@greg:unrelenting.technology</a> :) It's working as my new IRC bouncer, so with that I've been able to say goodbye to the previous VPS that served this website (which was still running my ZNC).</p>
