<p><a href="http://hisham.hm/htop/">htop 2.0</a> is cross-platform and improved and just really cool! I’ve added <a href="https://github.com/hishamhm/htop/pull/359/files">FreeBSD support for the battery life meter</a>. It was really simple compared to <a href="https://github.com/hishamhm/htop/blob/5c593fae4227651075cfc9445f17dad6ae0a0b47/linux/Battery.c">what they have for Linux</a> – two ways of reading battery info, both involve the file system, which means messing around with I/O and strings.</p><a href="https://brid.gy/publish/twitter"></a>
