It is well known that [Enlightenment/EFL is pretty awful](https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15001/enlightened). But I had to build it on my FreeBSD box since I'm testing a [LuaJIT update](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=225342) and EFL does include LuaJIT support.  So while I'm at it, I decided to add Wayland support to the port.

So at least it works, but its behavior is indeed kinda funny. Running their terminal with GL acceleration (`ELM_DISPLAY=wl ELM_ACCEL=opengl terminology`) actually does work. Running it *without* acceleration (`ELM_DISPLAY=wl ELM_ACCEL=no terminology`) results in the surface not showing up andâ€¦ *this message*:

```
DRM_IOCTL_I915_GEM_APERTURE failed: Invalid argument
Assuming 131072kB available aperture size.
May lead to reduced performance or incorrect rendering.
get chip id failed: -1 [2]

```

It's no "SPANK! SPANK! SPANK!" but *how exactly* did it decide to use an Intel GPU related system call? On my machine that *has a Radeon card*?!?! When I asked for software rendering??
