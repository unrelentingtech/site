<p>Converted my music library from mostly-AAC to Opus: from 11.3 GB down to 5.2 GB! (using <a href="https://gist.github.com/myfreeweb/f1906faa6ad8eb122ee47c23fff24ff4">some PowerShell</a> to run ffmpeg on all the things) This is especially good for my phone. For some reason Android still needs the file extension to be <code>.ogg</code> not <code>.opus</code>.</p>
<p>Compression in general seems to be a pretty exciting field… <a href="https://github.com/redox-os/tfs">Redox TFS</a> promises full disk compression. Maybe not really “full” but with large huge clusters, instead of ZFS’s per-block compression. Brotli already works in browsers for HTTPS compression. <a href="http://www.binomial.info/blog/?category=Compressor">Game texture stuff</a> is improving (because <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/540810/">58 GB texture packs</a> :D). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NETVC">A better video codec</a> is coming.</p>
<p>If you still have AAC or Vorbis files — convert to Opus now!</p>
