Noticed [something on dmesgd](https://dmesgd.nycbug.org/index.cgi?do=view&id=5124)…
looks like MIPS (64) isn't that dead: [new(ish) Ubiquiti EdgeRouters](https://www.ui.com/edgemax/edgerouter-4/)
have newer Octeon processors — quad-core 1GHz (and with an FPU). And 1GB RAM.
That's much better than the Lite's dual-core 500MHz && 512MB RAM.

…wait, actually, [there's even big 16-cores (and 16GB RAM) in 10G routers](https://dotbalm.org/hands-on-with-the-new-edgerouter-infinity/)!
