<p><a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/highdpi.html">Qt Quick 2’s high DPI scaling</a> is utterly ridiculous. Automatic scaling only uses integer factors, which means comically huge UI elements on a 4K desktop monitor where 150% is the appropriate factor — it literally gets rounded to 200%. The weirdest thing though: fonts sized in points are scaled to the exact DPI of the monitor, ignoring the rounded UI scaling factor. Which means that the UI elements on my desktop are bigger than on a low DPI monitor, <em>relative to the text inside of them</em>. What were they thinking?!</p>
<p>When will UI toolkit developers STOP believing that non-integer scaling is bad?</p>
