Wow, [Opera 48 converts units, time zones and currencies on text selection](https://blogs.opera.com/desktop/2017/09/convert-measurements-currencies-time-zones-opera-48/). That's really awesome.

[Some](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/metric-cooking/) [WebExtensions](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/temperature-converter-tool/) [attempt](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/autometric/) [similar things](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/immediate-currency-converter/) but as there's no native select popover thingy in Firefox, they either add a context menu item (okay) or just edit text inline (please don't). At least they don't inject custom UI into the page.
