An SPI flash chip module arrived in the mail today. I ordered that for replicating [this](https://linux-sunxi.org/File:Xunlong_Orange_Pi_PC_with_improvised_SPI_flash_shield.jpg) basically. To (network) boot the Orange Pi PC without microSD.

Naturally, instead of booting Linux to flash or (?) trying flash from U-Boot itself, time was spent on [making flashrom work on FreeBSD](https://github.com/flashrom/flashrom/pull/53) :)
