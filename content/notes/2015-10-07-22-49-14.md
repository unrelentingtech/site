<p>Just spent an hour trying to figure out why <code>~/.Xcompose</code> doesn’t work. Turns out it’s actually <code>~/.XCompose</code>, with the capital <code>C</code>. I usually like case sensitivity… but this ∉ good things! ✗</p>
<p>By the way, you can use <code>~/.XCompose</code> on OS X (by converting it to <code>DefaultKeyBindings.dict</code> using <a href="http://bob.cakebox.net/osxcompose.php">a perl script</a>) and on Windows (using <a href="https://github.com/samhocevar/wincompose">WinCompose</a>).</p>
