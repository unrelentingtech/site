[Ported the Firefox Profiler to FreeBSD](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D73162) in order to investigate why
[WebRender has some jank when scrolling some walls of text](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1634472) on my 4K/HiDPI setup.

The profiler code initially looked somewhat scary:
some [Google Breakpad](https://github.com/google/breakpad) code is used,
a custom stack unwinder called LUL is used on Linux (which also partially derived from Breakpad code)â€¦

Initially, I got it working with "pre-symbolication" (an option to build the [goblin](https://github.com/m4b/goblin) ELF parser
into Firefox for this purpose) only, ifdef'ing any Breakpad code out.

Turns out:

- the only part of Breakpad used is extracting build IDs from shared objects
  (and in fact the "base profiler", a copy (for now) of the Gecko profiler used for profiling during the early startup phase,
  just copied all the relevant code);
- `devel/breakpad` was there in FreeBSD Ports (but expires in like three days!),
  and its patches showed that it's really trivial to get all it working.

So I got the main symbolication system working. Which, it turns out, runs
[WebAssembly-compiled goblin](https://github.com/mstange/profiler-get-symbols) in a web worker!
Fun stuff. [Requires stripping `libxul` for now tho](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1615066).

In the end, the patch turned out to be mostly just `ifdef`'s!
The only meaningful parts are: `thr_self`/`thr_kill2` instead of `gettid`/`tgkill`,
supporting the different `mcontext` structs, and
(for the pre-symbolication code path) ignoring symbol names returned by `dladdr` because they're hilariously bad.

BTW, earlier in the dev-tools-on-FreeBSD space: [heaptrack](https://github.com/KDE/heaptrack/pull/24)!
I even used it [to find a real memory leak in Wayfire](https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/477).
