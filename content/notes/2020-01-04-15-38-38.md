Current Windows 10 has a feature called "[Windows Sandbox](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-kernel-internals/windows-sandbox/ba-p/301849)"
which spawns a tiny Hyper-V VM with allegedly a very smart slim disk image thing that shares the OS files with the host, and smart memory management, and so on.. and virtualized GPU support,
like [virgl](https://virgil3d.github.io/) in the free world.

So can it run Crysis, or at least Quake? Is it what we need for isolating old games?
Well.. it has the ability to load up the host GPU with work and to show the results, but it's absolutely unsuitable for gaming in its current state.
Seems like it uses regular RDP for the window, and there aren't any special optimizations that make 3D fast. The frame pacing is awful, framerate is weirdly limited, etc.

Also, this is not obviously found on google right now: if you have a compressed disk, you need to decompress `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Containers` for it to work.
