<p>AWS Route 53 looks like a nice DNS hosting service because API (<a href="https://disjoint.ca/til/2016/03/26/lets-encrypt-tls-certificates-using-route53-dns-verification/">automated ACME DNS verification</a>&nbsp;is pretty cool) and automatic config for adding domains to other AWS things but they're really slow with new DNS record types. <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=236806&amp;start=75&amp;tstart=0">Still no CAA</a>! <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=598211#598211">And SSHFP</a>! What in the hell, the most powerful Cloudâ„¢ company in the world can't add a simple record type?</p>
