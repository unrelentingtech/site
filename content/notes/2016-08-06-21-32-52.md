<p>So I’m switching between <code>libressl</code>, <code>libressl-devel</code> and <code>openssl</code> on my FreeBSD Raspberry Pi to see if any of them works (without segfaulting) when used from Python (spoiler: they don’t). And suddenly! Deinstalling <code>openssl</code> results in this:</p>
<pre><code>pkg: sqlite error while executing DELETE FROM packages WHERE id = ?1; in file pkgdb.c:2305: database disk image is malformed
</code></pre>
<p>But I can query <code>/var/db/pkg/local.sqlite</code> using the SQLite shell! WTF. Maybe some index got corrupted or something because of the awful microSD storage of the Pi.</p>
<p>So, recovery procedure I figured out: move the database to a different place, recreate a new one (run, like, <code>pkg upgrade</code>), use <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/7526055/239140">a clever grep trick</a> to separate the data from the schema (on the old DB, obviously), do some manual editing on the resulting data-only file (the trick doesn’t catch <code>pkg_search</code> because it’s a virtual table created using an <code>INSERT</code> or something), pipe the resulting SQL into the newly created database, use the shell to delete everything related to the offending package.</p>
<p>No, pkgng doesn’t like it when you just dump the DB into a new file, it will try to recreate tables as if you were upgrading. For some reason.</p>
