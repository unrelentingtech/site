Another weird LLVM mystery solved!

So, I was [porting LDC to FreeBSD/aarch64](https://github.com/ldc-developers/druntime/pull/146), wondering why global constructors (you know, the before-`main()` code you can make in C using an `__attribute__` thingy) aren't running… but only when the executable is linked with LLD. Turns out:

- `.init_array` is the only supported way to do constructors on AArch64
- and everything in general is moving towards `.init_array` — but the default in LLVM is still to emit `.ctors`
- [clang has code to enable `.init_array` when appropriate](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/clang/blob/5897428cd24e2deefbcc6f6744c0d7d233aa6747/lib/Driver/ToolChains/Gnu.cpp#L2598-L2620), ldc did not
- and the reason it all worked fine with bfd and gold is that these linkers SILENTLY convert `.ctors` to `.init_array`. For PERFORMANCE REASONS.
