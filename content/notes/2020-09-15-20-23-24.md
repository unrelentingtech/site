[Burstable Graviton2 instances](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-t4g-instances-burstable-performance-powered-by-aws-graviton2/)
are now a thing. Cool! Changed the instance type for this website from `a1.medium` to `t4g.micro` so that Jeff Bezos gets less of my money :P
(Basically no money until the end of this year, even â€” there's a free trial for `t4g.micro` for all AWS accounts!)
