<p>Apparently, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10835045">in the US, youâ€™re required to register your software if it uses any encryption</a>, with some weird exceptions. Oh, and Google Play still wants your home address if you want to sell apps for money.</p>
<p>This is terrible. Developers must always be able to publish software without exposing any personal information and without dealing with any governments.</p>
