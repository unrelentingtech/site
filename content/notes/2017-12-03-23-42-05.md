So there's no support in pretty much all Wayland compositors for fancy keyboard mapping utilities like [xcape](https://github.com/alols/xcape) because no one wants a keylogging protocol extension. (Even an access-controlled one!! Why.)

Turns out it's better to just solve this on the evdev level. And I've done it in the coolest way possible: with a tiny sandboxed scripting environment. Meet [evscript](https://github.com/myfreeweb/evscript)! It runs [Dyon](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/dyon) scripts in an environment with evdev, uinput, stdout and nothing else. xcape functionality is already provided in the "standard library" :)
