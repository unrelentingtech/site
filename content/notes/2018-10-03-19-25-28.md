It's almost 2019, so using a SATA SSD as the boot drive for your main development OS is not cool anymoreâ€¦ and I was running out of space on this 128gb one, so I bought an NVMe drive to replace it. Yay.

Because I don't have anything with two or more M.2 slots and I was too lazy to find/make a bootable FreeBSD USB drive, moving the system involved inserting the new drive into another machine (server) and using ZFS replication to copy the data. (And forgetting to set `bootfs` on the pool, of course.)

But the fun part was that my 10G network card stopped working. Moving the card into the middle slot (from the bottom one) fixed it. [Reported a FreeBSD bug](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=231923).

The weirdest discovery of the day though was that [MSI mainboards persist the "above 4G" PCIe setting *across CMOS clears*](https://forum-en.msi.com/index.php?topic=299100.0). What in the actual heck. This is the setting that breaks display output on most GPUs (funnily enough, mine did display non-EFI things such as the network card's boot prompt and the glitchy way FreeBSD displays the console when booting on UEFI with the EFI framebuffer disabled). It's a setting you very much *need* to clear.
