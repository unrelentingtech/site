BREAKING FreeBSD NEWS: AMDGPU DC works!

The 4.15 drm update apparently [did not have amdgpu working yet](https://github.com/FreeBSDDesktop/kms-drm/commit/63c705716c71b7c9cd5fd9877ec82d3caedb1f92)... but I tried it anyway, since that's just an assertion failure.

Well... it does work. Even with DC (`compat.linuxkpi.dc="1"`)! Weston didn't work at first, but commenting out its "Disable all the planes" section that was causing a kernel warning solved the problem.

So quite possibly [we have Vega support?](https://github.com/FreeBSDDesktop/kms-drm/issues/56)
