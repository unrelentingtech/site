text = "URL: leclan.ch/tabs/\nUnfortunately, I feel I have to increasingly justify myself for preferring tabs. I do justify it, though.\n[…]\nTabs are inherently perfect for indentation. They embody the concept of indentation.\n[…]\nTheir size adapts to anyone’s readability needs, unlike spaces which force you to accept the project’s indentation levels.\n[…]\nMore perfectly in design, tabs can be replaced by spaces with sed; but such an operation only goes one way.\nAnd that is exactly why I prefer tabs as well. It’s a special character which is easy to search and replace if that is ever needed. Space is good for separating words, but using spaces for indention is the same as using spaces for centering titles in Word(-like) documents."
