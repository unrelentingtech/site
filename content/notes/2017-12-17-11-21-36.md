haha, [Phoronix wrote about the stuff I posted on wayland-devel@](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Weston-FreeBSD-HiDPI-Rust). So yeah, I'm working on [Rust bindings for libweston](https://github.com/myfreeweb/weston-rs) that would eventually allow me to write the best Wayland compositor ever :)

And fractional HiDPI scaling was pretty easy to add. Wayland apps look awesome. However, X11 apps are blurry now, and bypassing the scaling for Xwayland is not as easy… So I made some changes to [my Ports fork](https://github.com/myfreeweb/freebsd-ports-dank) to enable Wayland support in more apps. Turns out a lot of complex applications run  fine — LibreOffice (!), Inkscape, MyPaint, RawTherapee, Darktable.

The [Firefox Wayland support](https://github.com/stransky/gecko-dev) though… is not usable yet :( It looks awesome but EGL isn't working and, even worse, the screen doesn't refresh when it needs to — so you're typing and letters don't appear until you scroll or some time passes. Hopefully this will be fixed soon.
