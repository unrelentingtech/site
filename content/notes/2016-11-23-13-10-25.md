<p>Upgraded my phone to CyanogenMod 14 (Android 7.1). Dirty flashed over CM13, everything went smoothly. Using <a href="https://github.com/ale5000-git/tingle">Tingle</a> to apply the signature spoofing patch for <a href="https://microg.org">microG</a> now, instead of Xposed.</p>
<p>If you’re going to do the same: the first boot after an upgrade — including a Tingle patch — takes some time, don’t panic. Also, Wi-Fi only started connecting correctly after a reboot.</p>
