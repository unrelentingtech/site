The touchscreen (both finger and pen support) on my Pixelbook has been broken for a while
(the Wacom digitizer was always present on i2c but it wasn't sending events).
There was like one time where I managed to get it to work briefly by holding the pen against it
in some way, but that was it.
Today I took the laptop out of the bag by the middle part, squeezing the lid a bit.
Aaaandâ€¦ touch works now!
Something was going on with wiring somehow inside the *lid* (not the hinge) I guess? :/
