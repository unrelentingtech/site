I went to `pull` the gadgetbridge repo today and look at [this shit](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2017/2017-06-02-MiBandTools.md). Someone issued a DMCA takedown because "reverse engineering of my work or sharing images from my work is strictly forbidden"?! Fuck off asshole, you can't copyright that. Apparently the reverse engineering is [bluetooth logs](https://www.reddit.com/r/pebble/comments/6ez4mk/fyi_gadgetbridge_code_offline_due_to_dmca_takedown/diej4ur/). What a dick.
