<p>Wow, the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-2-time-2-and-core-an-entirely-new-3g-ultra">new Pebble kickstarter</a> is, once again, amazing. Larger screens on watches and a “tiny, unlocked Android 5.0 computer” with Wi-Fi and 3G, so… maybe the dream external modem? (As in, external modem + “smartphone” without the phone part, because embedded mobile modems are scary from a security perspective)</p>
