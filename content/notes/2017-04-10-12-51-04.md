<p>One of the benefits of using <a href="http://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a> + LaTeX for typesetting documents instead of using LaTeX directly: Pandoc has its own syntax highlighting built in, which is much simpler than <a href="https://github.com/gpoore/minted">literally calling out to Pygments from LaTeX</a>.</p>
