AWS CloudFormation looks rather disappointing:

- the import functionality is a joke?? you *have* to make the template yourself, for some reason there's no "make template from this real thing" button??
- even that import thing cannot import an ACM certificate at all, literally says that's unsupported.
- the GUI designer thing does not know anything about CloudFront!

What.
