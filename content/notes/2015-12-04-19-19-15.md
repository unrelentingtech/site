<p>OS X El Capitan has a LOT of high-CPU-usage bugs! The last one I’ve experienced is <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/187924/xcode-app-gets-scanned-by-socketfilterfw-os-x-firewall-at-every-launch">the firewall checking Xcode’s signature for no reason</a>. Before that, <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/108">notifyd 100% CPU caused by tmux</a>.</p>
<p>Feels like OS X is turning into Windows.</p>
