<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a>, the new awesomeness in Cloud Computing™, reminds me of… <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface">CGI</a>.</p>
<p>In Lambda, HTTPS requests are just one of the many types of events it can handle, but it’s the most interesting one. There’s been some IndieWeb interest in using Lambda for <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/Micropub">Micropub</a> and <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/Webmention">Webmention</a> endpoints that update static websites.</p>
<p>We can do better! No SDK required. We need a CGI Cloud. I might build that as a demo for <a href="https://github.com/myfreeweb/sandblast">sandblast</a> :-)</p>
