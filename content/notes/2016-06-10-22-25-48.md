<p>On Android, it’s possible to take <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MsV3D3">a shadertoy</a> and (with obvious modifications) turn it into <a href="https://gfycat.com/EcstaticHatefulFlycatcher">a live wallpaper</a>, thanks to <a href="http://markusfisch.de/ShaderEditor.html">ShaderEditor</a>! Unfortunately, looks like the live wallpaper’s render is tied to the whole UI render, so if your device can only manage around 40 fps with the shader you choose, the UI will feel slow when the wallpaper is visible.</p>
