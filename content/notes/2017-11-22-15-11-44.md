So I was reading the [OpenBSD Chromebook Pixel post](https://jcs.org/notaweblog/2016/08/26/openbsd_chromebook): it did not wake up from suspend without the TPM driver. Hmm.

Disabled TPM on my Thinkpad X240 and FreeBSD RESUMES FROM SUSPEND!!! Wow. I guess I'll stop using the TPM then (I was using it [for SSH keys](https://github.com/ThomasHabets/simple-tpm-pk11). And I did unload the tpm kernel module before suspend!)
