Wi-Fi not connecting (well, getting instantly deauthed due to `AP-STA-POSSIBLE-PSK-MISMATCH` after connecting)
is apparently a [relatively](https://github.com/kaloz/mwlwifi/issues/278)
[common](https://forum.openwrt.org/t/ap-sta-possible-psk-mismatch/28135) problem with IoT devices.
And most people seem to point to ESP8266-based ones.

Well, I've never had a problem with ESP, but today I've been setting up an
RTL8711AF based device (Xiaomi `qmi.powerstrip.v1`) and it was failing just like that.

Turns out this device just completely fails when 802.11w Management Frame Protection
is on (even optionally). Ugh. Thanks Realtek.
