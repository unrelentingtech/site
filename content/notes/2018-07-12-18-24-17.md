For 0.5 dollars per hour (or currently 0.1/hr if you reserve for 24h?) on packet.net you can get access to a dedicated dual-socket Cavium ThunderX server with 128GB RAM and a 250GB SSD.
I took it for a few hours and now [lang/crystal](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=229636), [lang/mono](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=229710) and some other ports work on aarch64.

Ironically, these two builds have involved long single-threaded compile processes. In the mono case, parallelism had to be disabled for C# compilation [to work around a concurrency bug](https://github.com/mono/mono/issues/7017).

At least building things like WebKitGTK+ (to test a [one line patch](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=228699)) and Krita felt awesome :D
