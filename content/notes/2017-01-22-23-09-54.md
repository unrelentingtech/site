<p>Todayâ€™s reason for an hour wasted on debugging: <a href="https://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/20160317002736.GA26688@dcvr.yhbt.net/">Ruby 2.0.0 enforces FD_CLOEXEC on file descriptors by default, need to pass <code>--keep-file-descriptors</code> to <code>bundle exec</code> to fix</a>. What the hell? Apparently <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/5041">they were concerned about security</a>. Okay, but doing that on interpreter level was super unexpected.</p>
