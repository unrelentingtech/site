text = "Just trimmed my site's build/test/deploy pipeline's lifecycle from 10 minutes to about 5 minutes. A fair saving but still not as speedy as I want.\nMy next job is to see whether I can cache the images on my own infra running a GitLab-runner, but I seem to be having some difficulty getting it running with a Unix file socket rather than a TCP socket - a shame because in the past the GitLab-runner has worked literally out of the box"

When my website had a "deployment" time measured in minutes, I was so unhappy, so unmotivated to work on it..
Now (after the Elixir rewrite) I just have a text editor and REPL open on the server.
Edit, save, run `recompile` in the REPL, changes are live.
As quick as the "good" old days of PHP :D
