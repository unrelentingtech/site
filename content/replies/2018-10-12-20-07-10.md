text = "In my last entry, I spoke a bit about my slight confusion with the state of\nthe Web as it is today. I also highlighted a bit on my confusion on the state of\naffairs for writing entries for my personal site. I want something that works\nparticularly to my needs but also be extensible. A (non-exhaustive) list of\nitems I’d want my website to handle follows:\n\nWebMention support\n  WebMentions are a modern form of pingbacks for the Web. I’d want my site to\nhandle the parsing, formatting and statistical aggregate of information when\nit comes to handling WebMentions. It’ll slightly eliminate my need to look\ninto using things like Isso for handling comments - the act of replying\ncould be on any place you find the post in question!\n  MicroPub extensibility\n  MicroPub is a specification that makes the act of handling content on one’s\nsite as straightforward as consuming a resource using a REST API with\na sprinkle of authentication. Something like this will allow me to make edits\nto my site on the fly with little effort from services that supports it!\n\nWith these two alone, I’d have something I can post from anywhere (namely the\nIndigenous Android client) and even ween off using other “first-party”\nclients to handle and interact with people. I’ve been working on this on the\nside for a few weeks now but a considerable amount of progress has been made.\nI have a rolling demo of it at nextgen. This is one of those projects\nwhere it’s a bit difficult to just explain but a lot easier to just show.\n\nSo I’ll do that. Once it’s in a good place, that is."
