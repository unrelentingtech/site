text = "XRay, the library that I use to parse URLs to show comments, now supports parsing direct Microformats JSON, ActivityStreams 2.0, as well as finding a rel=alternate link and parsing data from that instead!\n\nThis means I now get great results when parsing Mastodon or other ActivityPub links, and this is also the first step in what I hope will result in fixing the Microformats situation for WordPress, since a WordPress plugin will be able to generate Microformats JSON and advertise that in a rel=alternate link.\n\nNext up is updating Aperture to take advantage of these new features!"
