Funnily enough I literally *can't* continue playing the only Blizzard game I kinda liked. After some update Overwatch is now tripping overcurrent protection, shutting my PC down as soon as it renders the first 3D frame :D (A few other games run into it too, but Overwatch was one that *never* ran into this before.)
