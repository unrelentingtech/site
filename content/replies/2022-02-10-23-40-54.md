Haha, Purism "GPL condom" :) Possibly more accurate to say "RYF condom" though since it was made specifically to make that certification possible.

CPU-loaded firmware trades off "you don't have to touch it" for "it's easier and safer to try replacing it", which actually sounds good, so it is silly that GNU/people have so much fear of touching firmware blobs.
