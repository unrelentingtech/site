hm, [the testing tool can find the h-card](https://sturdy-backbone.glitch.me/test?url=https%3A%2F%2Funrelenting.technology%2Fnotes%2F2019-09-16-17-55-29).

I didn't have it for a brief period right after deploying the new engine, maybe monocle cached its absence? (o_0)
or it doesn't support that way of finding the card (would be odd)
