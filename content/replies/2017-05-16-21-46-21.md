<p>By the way, your wordpress has two indieweb issues currently:</p>
<ul>
<li>notes have type <code>h-as-note</code> (which is unnecessary) but not <code>h-entry</code> (which is absolutely required) — as a result my replies have just a link to your note instead of a nice reply-context;</li>
<li>replies to comments are just wordpress comments that have no permalink — as a result my site can’t show them as replies (I guess you could just not use WP comment replies and reply with reply posts deliberately…).</li>
</ul>
<p>But yeah, I went with a homemade solution. That was… a lot of time spent. Though I did everything in the hardest way possible :D</p>
