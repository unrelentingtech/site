text = "9 years later, I'm blogging again\n                    2 min read\n            I started my first blog in 2005, only to suspend it in 2008. However, my urge to break the character and formatting limits of Twitter, Mastodon, and short-form status posts in general, has been growing for years now.\nSo I think it's finally time to blog again. No 10-page thinkpieces, but slightly longer-form thoughts and ideas, plus maybe the occasional essay.\nTopics will mostly be decentralized (pardon the Zs) and federated Web and communication technologies. Personally, I'm working on remoteStorage and Kosmos, so expect me to write about those more than about others. Also, I'm concerned both professionally and personally with the Web Platform in general, and installable, offline-capable apps in particular.\nRegarding comments: this is my personal IndieWeb-enabled website (running on Known), so if you'd like to reply in long form as well, you can send Webmentions to my post URLs. I'm also syncing comments from Twitter and Facebook back to my site, so if you reply there, it will also be seen here.\nSo, let's see how this experiment goes!\n\nUpdate: The RSS feed for just the blog posts (minus status posts and all other content) is located here."

<p>nice! I’ve been thinking about remoteStorage + IndieWeb… would be nice if remoteStorage got an option to use a link rel instead of WebFinger :)</p>
