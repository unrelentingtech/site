Alas, they are not, and it makes more sense to be a bookmark.\n\nI've since updated the posts using the wrong type and will get things right next time!"

hmm, but https://indieweb.org/repost very much says "retweet from your own site",
and the bookmark page says you should only use bookmark when not reposting content.

Looks like bookmark works better for long articles, but repost for short, tweet-like notes.
