text = "Thanks, I’ve been looking at remoteStorage too… It’s exactly what I want as far as the user bringing their own storage, but it appears to be 1) file system-y and 2) geared mainly toward client-side javascript apps. Ideally I’d find something that worked more like a document DB and had either an HTTP API or Python support."

<p>remoteStorage <em>is</em> an HTTP API! The only way it’s browser-oriented is the OAuth implicit grant, which returns the access token in the <code>#...</code> fragment of the URL.</p>
<p>Yeah, it’s unfortunate that the more document-y things like <a href="http://hood.ie">hood.ie</a> are mostly focused on providing a backend to frontend developers, not bring-your-own-storage.</p>
<p>But I have an idea! <a href="https://couchdb.apache.org">CouchDB</a> (or <a href="https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb-server">pouchdb-server</a>, same thing but in Node) is pretty much <em>the</em> HTTP-based document DB. It’s great. All we need is a way to discover a user’s CouchDB instance (a link <code>rel</code>) and a way to authenticate to it using IndieAuth.</p>
