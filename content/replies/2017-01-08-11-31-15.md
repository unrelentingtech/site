text = "In this interesting article Wesley Moore writes about switching away from macOS. He writes about his motivation and reasons:\nAccess to regularly updated, pro hardware.\nNot restricted to Apple hardware that makes choices that I don’t value, such as:\nRemoving the Esc key.\nRemoving all legacy ports necessitating the use of dongles for everything.\nPrioritising thinness and weight over everything else.\nAccess to hardware that Apple doesn’t make, such as 2-in-1 laptops.\nGetting comfortable with an alternative before I’m forced to.\nThe ability to inspect and contribute to the OS I use.\nUsing an OS where developers are first-class citizens.\nSee stagnation of the Mac App Store.\nI can understand his reasons: I for myself have similar problems with Apple nowadays (besides the moral issues). Interestingly he also favors elementary OS:\nElementary is stunning and definitely my favourite. It won’t appeal to everyone but their philosophies and direction really resonate with me.\nI'm trying out elementary as well (using it for a week now, I am pretty happy with it), so it was nice to read that somebody else likes it as well - especially since loads of Linux users I know think that this not the way Linux is supposed to be."

<p>I think some people didn’t like how Elementary is asking for money (pay what you want type thing) on the download page for some reason…</p>
<p>Honestly, I recommend not being tied to a particular OS and just, like, using all of them. I have Windows on my desktop, FreeBSD on my laptop, RPi and servers, Arch Linux in a VM… no (actively used) Macs anymore though :D</p>
