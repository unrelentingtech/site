text = "Over the weekend I have been moving my stuff from a dedicated server to three DigitalOcean droplets (affiliate link). I'm down from 60 EUR to about 20 EUR. Yay! :)\nI also took the chance and moved my configuration to deployment via ansible. What a relief!\nI also have to admit, I'm impressed by the work DO did, it is really fast to create a new droplet. It is just a matter of under a minute."
