text = "The problem\n[...] PROBLEM: The cursor always slowly moves to the lower left. One pixel every few seconds1.[...]\nI had the exact same issue2: painfully slowly drifting Trackpoint on my X250, never stopping. I'm aware of the Trackpoint self-calibration, I had that on the X200, on the T400, and on the T500, but this was different. If you have the pointer moving fast or just rarely on it's own, that is normal. In my case, it never stopped.\nThe really surprising thing was that this only happened under Debian Stretch (RC2) and not under Ubuntu 16.04, so I started looking around /sys:\nNote: it's probably serio2, but could be 3, 4, etc., depending on module load order and number of input devices.\n# ls /sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio1/serio3\nbind_mode    driver       id       mindrag          protocol    resolution   speed      upthresh\ndescription  drvctl       inertia  modalias         rate        resync_time  subsystem  ztime\ndraghys      ext_dev      input    power            reach       sensitivity  thresh\ndrift_time   firmware_id  jenks    press_to_select  resetafter  skipback     uevent\nMost of these are pretty much undocumented and so far none of the GUI configuration managers supported them. The 3 interesting ones are drift_time, sensitivity, and speed in this case.\nDespite this fix, this is most probably a hardware problem, so consider replacing the keyboard, especially if it's still under warranty, though if it doesn't happen under Windows, this will be near impossible to get through the service.\nTemporary fix\nMost will recommend to lower the sensitivity, but that doesn't always work or help.\necho 2 &gt; /sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio1/serio2/drift_time\necho 180 &gt; /sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio1/serio2/sensitivity\necho 50 &gt; /sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio1/serio2/speed\nKeep it after reboot\nsystemd-tmpfiles --prefix=/sys --create\nsensible-editor /etc/tmpfiles.d/trackpoint.conf\nw /sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio1/serio2/speed - - - - 50\nw /sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio1/serio2/sensitivity - - - - 180\nw /sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio1/serio2/drift_time - - - - 2\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/1200352/thinkpad-trackpoint-moves-on-its-own-on-linux↩\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/68sxua/x250_trackpoint_acting_up_on_debian_up_to_date/↩"

wow, never had that issue on my X240. I wonder if it's the FreeBSD driver being good or the hardware being perfectly calibrated :D
