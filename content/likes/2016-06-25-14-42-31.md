text = "Everyone’s hating on 2016 and saying they want to skip it or turn it off and on again calling it the worst year ever and I understand being upset about a lot of the big things that are happening but a lot of good, important, beautiful things have happened too, but maybe they just haven’t been as visible to you. 2016 so far has been one of the best years of my life, I feel like I’m more alive, more human, more connected and loved than ever before, I have my career developing positively in ways I feel good about and I’m closer to my friends family and spouse than I’ve ever been before. Please don’t turn off 2016, I still need it. I hope you can see similar good things in your own 2016 and remember that we can always make it better."
