text = "I’m launching a new side project today! Indie Map is a public IndieWeb social graph and dataset. It’s a complete crawl of 2300 of the most active IndieWeb sites, sliced and diced and rolled up in a few useful ways:\n\nSocial graph API and interactive map.\nSQL queryable dataset and GUI analytics.\nRaw crawl data in WARC format: 2300 sites, 5.7M pages, 380GB HTML + mf2.\n\nThe IndieWeb‘s raison d’être is to do social networking on individual personal web sites instead of centralized silos. Some parts have been fairly straightforward to decentralize – publishing, reading, interacting – but others are more difficult. Social graph and data mining fall squarely in the latter camp, which is why the community hasn’t tackled them much so far. I hope this inspires us to do more!\n\nIndie Map was announced at IndieWeb Summit 2017. Check out the slide deck and video (soon!) for more details. Also on IndieNews."
