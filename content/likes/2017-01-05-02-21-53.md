text = "2016 doesn’t just feel like the longest year in a while, it actually is. It’s both a leap year and has a leap second, which is notoriously dangerous to the internet and computers in general.\n\nHappy New Year! And karma and hugs to ops people on call everywhere. May the queries flow and the pagers slumber."
