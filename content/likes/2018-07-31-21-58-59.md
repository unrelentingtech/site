[extra.like_of.content]
text = "Responding to user support tickets is an interesting task. You've got to balance the right tone by acknowledging that the user who's written you is probably frustrated, but also you've usually got to be careful not to admit fault if the app is actually behaving as anticipated. The app isn't broken, but the user isn't wrong. Expectations weren't met. My job in responding to the support ticket becomes finding a way to bridge the gap, and, if at all possible, meet the expectation."
