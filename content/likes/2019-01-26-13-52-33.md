There's been several new plugins and services launch support for IndieAuth, and it's even made appearances at several events around the world!\n\n\n\nMicro.blog added native support for IndieAuth, so your hosted micro.blog account is now also an IndieAuth provider\n  Dobrado launched native support for IndieAuth\n  The IndieAuth Plugin for Drupal launched in the beginning of the year, and has had several releases since then\n  The IndieAuth Plugin for Grav adds support to your Grav site by delegating to indieauth.com\n  The IndieAuth Plugin for WordPress had a major rewrite and supports IndieAuth natively now\n\nI presented IndieAuth at the W3C Workshop on Strong Authentication &amp; Identity in December, and even published a video of the talk afterwards!\n\nphoto by Karen Myers\n\nAt API Days Global, oauth.io presented a session including IndieAuth.\n\nJosh Hawxwell gave a talk at NottsJS called Indie What? where he covered several IndieWeb building blocks including IndieAuth.\n\nphoto by @NottsJS\n\nIn July, I wrote a blog post called OAuth for the Open Web, where I detailed the technical solutions IndieAuth provides on top of OAuth to enable it to work in a more open and less corporate environment.\nIn October, I published Dweb: Identity for the Decentralized Web with IndieAuth on the Mozilla Hacks Blog.\nSo here's to a productive year for IndieAuth in 2018!
