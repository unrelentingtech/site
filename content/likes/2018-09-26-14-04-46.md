[extra.like_of.content]
text = "Last summer I listened endlessly to Sia, and now the sound of her voice POWERFULLY invokes sunny Sarajevo; the feeling of hanging out by myself in my little flat, making flatbreads and waiting 4 hours for beans to cook in my half-assed kitchen, and feeling very very sad about something. If I'm feeling even a tiny bit fragile, just a couple of seconds of hearing her can make me burst into tears on the spot, from a combination of how I was feeling last summer, and a touch of Sarajevo-homesickness. Doesn't even have to be a song I know, just her voice. Which is slightly problematic, as she's still played in public spaces a lot. And also because I just want to listen to her when I need something bouncy and sometimes I can't."
