text = "Our third visit to Wales was in autumn, and though I've not yet been there during winter, I can safely state it's always beautiful.\nBeddgelert is a small community; the name of the place originates from a sad story of a heroic dog. It can offer you magnificent views of the local mountains and hills so don't miss it if you're close.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPENTAX K-5 II s\n\n\n\t\tf/8.0\n\n\n\t\t1/320 sec\n\n\n\n\t\tISO 160\n\n\n\t\tHD PENTAX-DA 16-85mm F3.5-5.6 ED DC WR\n\n\n\t\t53.009094\n\t\t\t\t-4.101897"
