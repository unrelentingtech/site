[extra.like_of.content]
text = "I learned a very subtle Ruby trick today.The Ruby parser will create local variables for every variable that might be set in your code before any of it is run.irb(main):001:0&gt; if false; x = 1; end\n=&gt; nil\nirb(main):002:0&gt; x.inspect\n=&gt; \"nil\"\nirb(main):003:0&gt;\n\nCompare with just checking for x:\n\nirb(main):001:0&gt; xNameError: undefined local variable or method `x' for main:Object    from (irb):1    from /Users/aaronpk/.rubies/ruby-2.1.3/bin/irb:11:in `&lt;main&gt;'\n\nJust to confirm what's happening:\n\nirb(main):001:0&gt; local_variables=&gt; [:_]irb(main):002:0&gt; if false; x = 1; end=&gt; nilirb(main):003:0&gt; local_variables=&gt; [:x, :_]irb(main):004:0&gt; x.inspect=&gt; \"nil\"irb(main):005:0&gt;\n\nThis may not seem particularly unusual at first, but has some surprising results when combined with, for example, Sinatra. Imagine you have this code that attempts to accept both a form-encoded and JSON post body.\n\npost '/example' do\n  if request.content_type.start_with? \"application/json\"\n    begin\n      params = JSON.parse(request.env[\"rack.input\"].read)\n    rescue\n      return {error: \"Error parsing JSON.\"}.to_json\n    end\n  end\n\n  # etc etc\n  # but params is always nil, even for form-encoded requests!\nend\n\nWhat's wrong with this picture? Well, the Ruby interpreter sees params = in the code and allocates a local variable. At that point, the hash that Sinatra sets isn't accessible from inside your block, so params will be nil when you try to use it!\n\nThe trick is to avoid setting params in the first place.\n\nget '/example/:id' do\n  if request.content_type == \"application/json\"\n    begin\n      payload = JSON.parse(request.env[\"rack.input\"].read)\n    rescue\n      return {error: \"Error parsing JSON.\"}.to_json\n    end\n  else\n    payload = params\n  end\n\n  # etc etc\n  # now you can use `payload` instead of params\nend\n\nThanks @donpdonp for the hint!"
